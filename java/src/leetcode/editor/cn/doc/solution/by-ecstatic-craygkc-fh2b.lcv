### 解题思路

1. CTE带原始顺序rk；
2. 自联结表on条件 表b.drink不为空，并且表b.rk要在表a.rk之前；
3. 对a.id开窗，根据a.rk-b.rk差值排序为rk1
4. 找差值rk1最小即可；

### 代码

* mysql

```mysql
with t as (
    select *,row_number() over() as rk
    from CoffeeShop
)
select id, if(drink is null, rep, drink) as drink 
from
    (select a.id, a.drink, a.rk, b.drink as rep, rank() over(partition by a.id order by a.rk - b.rk) as rk1
    from t a
    left join t b 
    on b.drink is not null and a.rk > b.rk)a
where rk1 = 1
order by rk
```
