### 解题思路

1. USE DISTINCT FOR POST ID IN ACTIONS AND REMOVALS;
2. USE GROUP BY AND COUNT TO GET THE DAILY PERCENT PER DATE;
3. USE AVG TO GET THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENT;

### 代码

* mysql

```mysql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(DAILY_PERCENT), 2) AS AVERAGE_DAILY_PERCENT
FROM (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT R.POST_ID) / COUNT(DISTINCT A.POST_ID) * 100 AS DAILY_PERCENT
      FROM ACTIONS AS A
      LEFT JOIN REMOVALS AS R
      ON A.POST_ID = R.POST_ID
      WHERE EXTRA = 'spam'
      GROUP BY ACTION_DATE) AS A;
```
