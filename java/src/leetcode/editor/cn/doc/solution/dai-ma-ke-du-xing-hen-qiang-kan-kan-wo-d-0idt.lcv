##### 首先将有消费记录的销售人员的总体消费金融计算出来

with t1 as (
select b.salesperson_id, sum(a.price) as total
from Sales as a
left join Customer as b
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id
group by b.salesperson_id
),

#### 处理没有消费的情况

t2 as (
select *
from t1
union all
select salesperson_id, 0 as total
from Salesperson
where salesperson_id not in (select salesperson_id from t1)
)

##### 两表连接得到结果

select t2.salesperson_id, c.name, t2.total
from t2
left join Salesperson as c
on c.salesperson_id = t2.salesperson_id;
