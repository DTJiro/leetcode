#这道题和平时思路不一样哦
#关键：
#（1）:u1 u2是friend
#(2):他们的common friend>=3个

* 

```

with a as (
select * from friendship 
union 
select user2_id,user1_id from friendship)

select f.user1_id,f.user2_id,count(*) as common_friend
from friendship f join a a1 
on f.user1_id = a1.user1_id 
join a a2 
on f.user2_id = a2.user1_id 
and a2.user2_id = a1.user2_id 
group by f.user1_id,f.user2_id
having count(*)>=3
```
