### 解题思路

dense_rank for 排序 and having count() > 1 for 排除一人的队伍

### 代码

* mysql

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id, name, b.salary, b.team_id
FROM Employees a
INNER JOIN
(SELECT salary, dense_rank() over (ORDER BY salary) AS team_id
FROM Employees
GROUP BY salary
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) > 1) b
ON a.salary = b.salary
ORDER BY b.team_id, employee_id
```
