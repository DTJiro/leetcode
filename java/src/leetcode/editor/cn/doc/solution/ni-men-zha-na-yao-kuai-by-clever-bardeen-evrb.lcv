# Write your MySQL query statement below
select user_id,page_id,count( frid) as friends_likes from (
select user1_id as user_id,page_id,user_id as frid  from Friendship a,
Likes b
where user2_id=user_id or user1_id=user_id
union 
select user2_id as user_id,page_id,user_id as frid from Friendship a,
Likes b
where user1_id=user_id or user2_id=user_id
) c
group by user_id,page_id
having 
count(if(user_id=frid,1,null))=0
order by user_id
```

是不是因为用了having的问题，很卡。。。
