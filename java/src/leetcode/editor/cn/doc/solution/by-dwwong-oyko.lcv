### 解题思路

主要是这个
SELECT ROWNUM AS ids FROM DUAL CONNECT BY ROWNUM <= (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers)
然后就not in

### 代码

* oraclesql

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
SELECT T.ids as "ids"
FROM
(SELECT ROWNUM AS ids 
FROM DUAL 
CONNECT BY ROWNUM <= (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers)
) T
WHERE T.ids NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers)
ORDER BY T.ids



```
