##### 思路

首先，我们要构造Result之中的前两列（cte1），可以用union直接把both嵌进去，然后再通过【每人每天用的不同平台数=2】的条件去定义【both】（cte2），然后再left join计算total_amount 和 total_users

##### 算法

1. 要构造Result之中的前两列

* sql

```sql
with cte1 as
(
    select distinct spend_date, 'desktop'  as platform from spending
    union 
    select distinct spend_date, 'mobile' from spending
    union
    select distinct spend_date, 'both' from spending
)

# 输出
{"headers": ["spend_date", "platform"], 
"values": [["2019-07-01", "desktop"], 
           ["2019-07-02", "desktop"], 
           ["2019-07-01", "mobile"], 
           ["2019-07-02", "mobile"], 
           ["2019-07-01", "both"], 
           ["2019-07-02", "both"]]}
```

2. 定义【both】

* sql

```sql
cte2 as
(
select
    user_id,
    spend_date,
    if(count(distinct platform)=2,'both',platform) as platform,
    sum(amount) as amount
from spending
group by 1,2
)

# 输出
{"headers": ["user_id", "spend_date", "platform", "amount"], 
"values": [[1, "2019-07-01", "both", 200], 
           [2, "2019-07-01", "mobile", 100], 
           [2, "2019-07-02", "mobile", 100], 
           [3, "2019-07-01", "desktop", 100], 
           [3, "2019-07-02", "desktop", 100]]}
```

3. left join计算

* sql

```sql
select 
    t1.spend_date,
    t1.platform,
    ifnull(sum(t2.amount),0) as total_amount,
    ifnull(count(t2.user_id),0) as total_users
from cte1 t1
left join cte2 t2
using(spend_date,platform)
group by 1,2
```

##### 答案

* sql

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

with cte1 as
(
    select distinct spend_date, 'desktop'  as platform from spending
    union 
    select distinct spend_date, 'mobile' from spending
    union
    select distinct spend_date, 'both' from spending
),

cte2 as
(
select
    user_id,
    spend_date,
    if(count(distinct platform)=2,'both',platform) as platform,
    sum(amount) as amount
from spending
group by 1,2
)


select 
    t1.spend_date,
    t1.platform,
    ifnull(sum(t2.amount),0) as total_amount,
    ifnull(count(t2.user_id),0) as total_users
from cte1 t1
left join cte2 t2
using(spend_date,platform)
group by 1,2
```
