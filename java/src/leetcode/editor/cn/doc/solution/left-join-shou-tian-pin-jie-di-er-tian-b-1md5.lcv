1.首先求出所有用户的首天时间
2.所有用户首天后的登录数据
3.left join 限定时间差一天和player_id相等 此时第二天没登陆的用户记为NULL
4.count() 函数自动剔除 第二天没数据的用户

* 

```
select first_date as 'install_dt', count(distinct a.player_id) as 'installs',
Round(count(distinct b.player_id)/count(distinct a.player_id), 2) as `Day1_retention`
from (
select player_id, min(event_date) as first_date from Activity group by player_id) a
left join Activity b 
on a.player_id = b.player_id and DATEDIFF(b.event_date, a.first_date)=1
group by first_date 

```
